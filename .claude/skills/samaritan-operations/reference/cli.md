## Key flags

### validate
- `--lint` — run shellcheck over `command`/`script` (warnings by default).
- `--strict` — promote lint warnings and schema warnings to errors.
- Always runs a built-in regex-lint over `expect` regex fields (`matches`,
  `all_lines_match`, `any_line_matches`, `no_line_matches`, `retry.while`):
  uncompilable patterns are errors; ReDoS-prone ones (e.g. `(a+)+`) are warnings
  (errors under `--strict`). No flag needed — regex compilation is built-in.

### generate manual / confluence
- `--env <name>` — single-environment heading format. Omitting it produces the
  multi-environment table format. These are two distinct rendering paths.
- `--output <path>` — write to file (defaults to stdout for Markdown).
- `--resolve-vars` — substitute `${VAR}` against the selected env's variables at
  generation time.

### generate postmortem / postmortem from-run
- `generate postmortem <file>` renders a **postmortem / incident report (RCA)** —
  a separate document type from operations (its own schema
  `src/schemas/postmortem.schema.json`; see `reference/postmortem-yaml.md`).
- `-f, --format markdown|confluence|adf` (default `markdown`); `-o` writes to a
  file, otherwise stdout. Confluence output wraps the Mermaid timeline in the
  `{markdown}` macro (same pattern as the operation Gantt).
- `postmortem from-run <session-id|events.jsonl>` seeds a postmortem YAML from a
  captured run record: timeline, participants, incident window, and
  `operation`/`run` back-references are auto-filled; narrative fields are `TODO`.
- `postmortem init` writes a blank template. This is a documentation feature —
  it does NOT execute anything.

### run
- Default mode is **sidecar**: SAMARITAN displays each resolved command but does
  NOT send it to tmux — the operator runs it, then presses `[v]` to verify
  `step.expect`.
- Other modes: `manual`, `automatic` (tmux-backed send/verify), `hybrid`.
- `--var KEY=VALUE` (repeatable) — supply a variable's value only at run time
  (e.g. reuse one manual for different report dates: `--var REPORT_DATE=...`).
  Precedence (low→high): `common_variables` → `operation.variables[env]` →
  `--var` → `step.variables`.
- If a `${VAR}` has no value from `--var`/env config and `run`/sidecar is
  attached to a real terminal (`process.stdin.isTTY`), you're prompted for it
  once at the start of the run (mutates the resolved vars in place, so the
  answer flows into the session/report). `--no-prompt` disables this and
  falls back to the old warn-and-continue behavior; the prompt is also
  automatically skipped for `--auto-approve`, `--dry-run`, and any
  non-interactive/CI run (no TTY) — those never block. See
  `examples/report-with-runtime-date.yaml`.
- `--mock` — replay each step's `expect` against `evidence.results[<env>]` output;
  prints PASS/FAIL/SKIP, exits non-zero on failure. No tmux/execution.
- `--attach <tmux-target>` — attach to an existing tmux pane instead of spawning.
- `--from-step <N>` — start at step N; earlier steps are recorded as **skipped**
  (distinct from `resume --from-step`, which marks earlier steps completed).
- `--report <dir>` — write an extra copy of the run report.
- `--auto-approve` — note: `automatic` context marks steps complete WITHOUT
  running commands (non-interactive execution is a roadmap item, not real).
- `--no-require-evidence` — disable the evidence-required gate (see below);
  also available on `resume`.

## Interactive run loop actions

Per manual/sidecar step:
- `[n]` note — free-text annotation
- `[e]` evidence — capture pane output / attach file / paste text
- `[x]` remove evidence — only shown once evidence exists
- `[v]` verify — run `step.expect` against captured pane output
- `[t]` attach pane — (sidecar) attach/swap a tmux capture backend mid-run
- `[p]` send to pane — (sidecar) paste the resolved command into the attached pane WITHOUT Enter (operator reviews + runs it), using **bracketed paste** (`paste-buffer -p`) so multi-line commands land as one atomic block instead of executing line-by-line; only when the step has a command and a pane is attached. Re-run during verify = `[p]` then `[v]`
- `[b]` back — go back to an earlier step and re-run from there (resets it + later steps to pending; audit log keeps the prior attempt); not offered on the first step
- `[j]` jump — jump **forward** to a later step; the current step through the target are recorded as **skipped** (⏭) in the report, execution resumes at the target; not offered on the last step. Startup equivalent: `run --from-step <N>`
- `[r]` rollback — run *this step's* `rollback`, stay on the step
- `[g]` global rollback — only when the operation declares a top-level `rollback:`. Previews + runs the consolidated recovery (explicit `rollback.steps` + every **completed** step's rollback in reverse order when `aggregate_step_rollbacks: true`), then aborts the operation
- `q` / `quit` / `Ctrl+C` — **aborts** the operation, persists session as `paused` (resumable) and prints a resume hint (`Ctrl+C` saves too — it no longer hard-quits without saving)

## Evidence-required gate

When a step has `evidence: { required: true }`, completing it (`manual`/sidecar
`Enter`, or `approval`'s `approve`) is **blocked** by default until either `[e]`
captures at least one evidence item, or the operator types `o` + a reason to
override (logged as a `user_input`/`override` event, same shape as an
overridden failed `[v]` assertion). Enter alone declines and returns to the
step's menu without completing it. Disable with `--no-require-evidence`. Does
NOT gate plain (non-sidecar) `type: automatic` steps.

## Run artifacts

Each `run`/`resume` writes a black box beside the operation at
`<op-dir>/.samaritan-runs/<id>/`:
- `events.jsonl` — append-only event stream
- `report.md` — always-on per-step verification ledger + approval trail; terminal-escape noise is cleaned from captured output and operator-local path prefixes (home `→ ~`, run dir, operation dir) are stripped so it's safe to share

`.samaritan-runs/` is gitignored (force-add to commit a run). Sessions also
persist to `~/.samaritan/sessions/<id>.json` for `resume`.

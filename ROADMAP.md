## üöß Phase 2: Execution & Evidence Collection (PLANNED)

**Goal**: Execute operations and automatically collect evidence

### 2.1 Command Execution Engine
- [ ] Execute `type: automatic` steps with command runner
- [ ] Capture stdout/stderr from command execution
- [ ] Timeout handling and process management
- [ ] Exit code validation
- [ ] Retry logic with configurable attempts
- [ ] Environment variable interpolation in commands
- [ ] Working directory management
- [ ] Command output streaming

**Priority**: HIGH
**Complexity**: Medium
**Estimated**: 2-3 weeks

### 2.2 Automatic Evidence Collection
- [ ] **Screenshot capture**: Automatic screen capture for GUI operations
- [ ] **Command output capture**: Save stdout/stderr as evidence
- [ ] **Log file collection**: Read and attach log files
- [ ] **File artifacts**: Collect generated files (configs, reports, etc.)
- [ ] **Video recording**: Record operation execution sessions
- [ ] Evidence validation (file size, format, content)
- [ ] Evidence storage and organization
- [ ] Evidence gallery in generated reports

**Priority**: HIGH
**Complexity**: High (requires OS-specific integrations)
**Estimated**: 3-4 weeks

**Technical Notes**:
- Screenshot: Use `puppeteer` for web, OS-specific tools for desktop
- Video: `ffmpeg` or platform screen recording APIs
- Storage: Local filesystem first, S3/cloud storage later

### 2.3 Interactive Execution Mode
- [ ] Step-by-step execution with user prompts
- [ ] Manual step instruction display
- [ ] Evidence upload interface (CLI file picker)
- [ ] Step completion confirmation
- [ ] Pause/resume functionality
- [ ] Skip step capability
- [ ] Rollback on failure
- [ ] Progress tracking and display

**Priority**: HIGH
**Complexity**: Medium
**Estimated**: 2 weeks

### 2.4 Session Management
- [ ] Session state persistence
- [ ] Resume interrupted operations
- [ ] Session history and logs
- [ ] Multi-session support
- [ ] Session export/import
- [ ] Checkpoint creation
- [ ] Session cleanup and archival

**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Complexity**: Low
**Estimated**: 1 week

## üîÆ Phase 3: Integrations & Automation (FUTURE)

**Goal**: Connect with external systems for approval, documentation, and alerting

### 3.1 Jira Integration
- [ ] Create approval tickets automatically
- [ ] Poll for approval status
- [ ] Link evidence to Jira issues
- [ ] Update ticket status on completion
- [ ] Comment with execution summary
- [ ] Custom field mapping
- [ ] Jira workflow transitions

**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Complexity**: Medium
**Estimated**: 2 weeks

### 3.2 Confluence Integration (Publishing)
- [ ] Direct publish to Confluence space
- [ ] Page creation and updates
- [ ] Attachment management
- [ ] Permission handling
- [ ] Version tracking
- [ ] Template management
- [ ] Bulk operations

**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Complexity**: Medium
**Estimated**: 1-2 weeks

### 3.3 Git Integration (Advanced)
- [ ] Git operations as steps (commit, push, tag)
- [ ] Branch management
- [ ] Pull request creation
- [ ] Merge operations
- [ ] Repository cloning
- [ ] Submodule handling

**Priority**: LOW
**Complexity**: Low
**Estimated**: 1 week

## üí° Phase 4: Intelligence & Optimization (RESEARCH)

**Goal**: AI-powered assistance and operation insights

### 4.1 AI Assistant (Interactive)
- [ ] OpenAI/Anthropic integration
- [ ] Contextual help during execution
- [ ] Error diagnosis and suggestions
- [ ] Step generation from natural language
- [ ] Operation optimization recommendations
- [ ] Chat interface in CLI
- [ ] Streaming responses

**Priority**: LOW
**Complexity**: High
**Estimated**: 3-4 weeks

**Technical Notes**:
- Start with simple prompt templates
- Context window management for long operations
- Cost optimization (use cheaper models for simple queries)

### 4.2 Operation Analytics
- [ ] Execution time tracking
- [ ] Success/failure rates
- [ ] Common failure patterns
- [ ] Step duration analysis
- [ ] Environment comparison
- [ ] Trend visualization
- [ ] Performance regression detection

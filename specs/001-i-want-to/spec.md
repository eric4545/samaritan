## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As an SRE engineer, I need an Operations as Code platform that eliminates repetitive manual work by defining procedures once in Git-versioned YAML format, executing them across multiple environments with complete audit trails, automatic evidence collection, and integrated approval workflows that work with existing tools like Jira for manager approvals. Optional AI assistance can provide contextual help when needed.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a complex deployment operation, **When** I define it once in YAML with environment variables, **Then** I can execute it in both preprod and production with different values
2. **Given** an operation with mixed automatic and manual steps, **When** I execute it, **Then** the system runs automated commands and prompts me for manual confirmations
3. **Given** an operation with preflight checklists, **When** I start execution, **Then** the system validates all prerequisites before proceeding with actual steps
4. **Given** reusable operation modules, **When** I reference them in my operation, **Then** the system includes their steps and variables seamlessly
5. **Given** a completed operation execution, **When** I request documentation, **Then** the system generates a formatted operation manual with environment comparison tables
6. **Given** an operation with approval gates, **When** I reach an approval step, **Then** the system blocks execution until proper authorization is received
7. **Given** a failed operation step, **When** rollback is configured, **Then** the system can automatically or manually trigger the rollback procedure
8. **Given** a manual step requiring evidence, **When** I complete the action, **Then** I can attach screenshots or the system automatically captures relevant evidence
9. **Given** an operation execution, **When** I need help with a step, **Then** I can optionally access AI assistance for contextual guidance
10. **Given** evidence collection during execution, **When** the operation completes, **Then** all evidence is automatically organized and included in documentation
11. **Given** an interrupted operation session, **When** I restart SAMARITAN, **Then** I can resume from the exact step where I left off
12. **Given** a failed step with retry capability, **When** I choose to retry, **Then** the system captures the failure reason, my retry decision rationale, and maintains complete retry history for audit purposes
13. **Given** a completed operation, **When** I request a release report, **Then** the system generates a comprehensive summary with timeline, evidence, and approvals
14. **Given** an on-call emergency situation, **When** I access the QRH mode, **Then** I can quickly find and execute pre-defined emergency procedures
15. **Given** a PagerDuty alert, **When** I search the QRH, **Then** I get relevant runbooks and quick response procedures
16. **Given** an operation requiring manager approval, **When** I reach an approval gate, **Then** the system creates a Jira ticket with operation details and waits for manager approval
17. **Given** Operations as Code in Git, **When** I modify operation definitions, **Then** the system tracks versions, enables peer review, and maintains change history
18. **Given** a marketplace of reusable operations, **When** I search for common tasks, **Then** I can discover and use community-contributed operation components
19. **Given** composite operations with dependencies, **When** I define an operation that needs other operations, **Then** the system automatically executes dependencies in correct order
20. **Given** conditional operation steps, **When** execution reaches a conditional step, **Then** the system evaluates conditions and skips or executes accordingly
21. **Given** operation templates, **When** I create a new operation, **Then** I can scaffold from common patterns (deployment, backup, maintenance)
22. **Given** operation artifacts from previous steps, **When** subsequent steps need the data, **Then** the system passes evidence and outputs seamlessly
23. **Given** an automated operation, **When** I request a manual mode playbook, **Then** the system generates manual instructions for every automated step
24. **Given** an operation running in automatic mode, **When** I choose to switch to manual mode mid-execution, **Then** the system pauses and provides manual instructions for remaining steps
25. **Given** a failed automated step, **When** the system offers manual override, **Then** I can execute the equivalent manual procedure and continue
26. **Given** an emergency situation, **When** I activate manual override mode, **Then** all subsequent steps execute as manual instructions with detailed commands

### Edge Cases
- What happens when automated commands fail or timeout?
- How does system handle partial manual step completion?
- What occurs if approval is denied or times out?
- How are environment variables handled when they're missing or invalid?
- What happens when rollback procedures themselves fail?
- How does the system handle corrupted or missing evidence files?
- What happens when automatic screenshot capture fails?
- How does the AI assistant handle ambiguous or unclear user questions?
- What happens when session data becomes corrupted or lost?
- How does the system handle concurrent sessions for the same operation?
- What occurs when Confluence page history reaches limits?
- How are emergency QRH procedures prioritized and organized?
- What happens when switching from auto to manual mode mid-operation?
- How does the system handle partial manual execution of automated steps?
- What occurs when manual override steps produce different outputs than automated versions?

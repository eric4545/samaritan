## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As an SRE engineer, I need an interactive AI-powered tool that eliminates repetitive manual work in operations by defining procedures once in YAML format that can be executed across multiple environments (preprod/production) while automatically collecting evidence (screenshots, logs) and generating comprehensive documentation with safety through approval gates and rollback mechanisms.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a complex deployment operation, **When** I define it once in YAML with environment variables, **Then** I can execute it in both preprod and production with different values
2. **Given** an operation with mixed automatic and manual steps, **When** I execute it, **Then** the system runs automated commands and prompts me for manual confirmations
3. **Given** an operation with preflight checklists, **When** I start execution, **Then** the system validates all prerequisites before proceeding with actual steps
4. **Given** reusable operation modules, **When** I reference them in my operation, **Then** the system includes their steps and variables seamlessly
5. **Given** a completed operation execution, **When** I request documentation, **Then** the system generates a formatted operation manual with environment comparison tables
6. **Given** an operation with approval gates, **When** I reach an approval step, **Then** the system blocks execution until proper authorization is received
7. **Given** a failed operation step, **When** rollback is configured, **Then** the system can automatically or manually trigger the rollback procedure
8. **Given** a manual step requiring evidence, **When** I complete the action, **Then** I can attach screenshots or the system automatically captures relevant evidence
9. **Given** an interactive chat session, **When** I ask questions about the operation, **Then** the AI assistant provides contextual help and guidance
10. **Given** evidence collection during execution, **When** the operation completes, **Then** all evidence is automatically organized and included in documentation

### Edge Cases
- What happens when automated commands fail or timeout?
- How does system handle partial manual step completion?
- What occurs if approval is denied or times out?
- How are environment variables handled when they're missing or invalid?
- What happens when rollback procedures themselves fail?
- How does the system handle corrupted or missing evidence files?
- What happens when automatic screenshot capture fails?
- How does the AI assistant handle ambiguous or unclear user questions?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST parse YAML files defining operations with steps, environments, and variables

### Key Entities
- **Operation**: Represents a complete procedure with name, environments, variables, and ordered steps
- **Step**: Individual action within operation, either automatic (command) or manual (instruction) with optional rollback
- **Environment**: Target deployment context (preprod, production) with specific variable values  
- **Approval Gate**: Checkpoint requiring authorization before proceeding to next step
- **Execution Log**: Immutable record of all commands executed, results, and timestamps
- **Operation Manual**: Generated documentation showing environment comparison and execution details
- **Preflight Checklist**: Set of validation checks that must pass before operation execution begins
- **Operation Module**: Reusable component containing steps, variables, and checklists that can be imported
- **Module Registry**: Collection of available operation modules for sharing and reuse
- **Evidence Item**: Digital proof of step completion (screenshot, log file, command output, photo)
- **AI Assistant**: Interactive chat interface providing contextual guidance during operations
- **Evidence Validator**: Component that checks evidence completeness and quality automatically

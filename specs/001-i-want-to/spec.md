## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As an SRE engineer, I need to eliminate repetitive manual work in operations by defining procedures once in YAML format that can be executed across multiple environments (preprod/production) while automatically generating documentation and ensuring safety through approval gates and rollback mechanisms.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a complex deployment operation, **When** I define it once in YAML with environment variables, **Then** I can execute it in both preprod and production with different values
2. **Given** an operation with mixed automatic and manual steps, **When** I execute it, **Then** the system runs automated commands and prompts me for manual confirmations
3. **Given** an operation with preflight checklists, **When** I start execution, **Then** the system validates all prerequisites before proceeding with actual steps
4. **Given** reusable operation modules, **When** I reference them in my operation, **Then** the system includes their steps and variables seamlessly
5. **Given** a completed operation execution, **When** I request documentation, **Then** the system generates a formatted operation manual with environment comparison tables
6. **Given** an operation with approval gates, **When** I reach an approval step, **Then** the system blocks execution until proper authorization is received
7. **Given** a failed operation step, **When** rollback is configured, **Then** the system can automatically or manually trigger the rollback procedure

### Edge Cases
- What happens when automated commands fail or timeout?
- How does system handle partial manual step completion?
- What occurs if approval is denied or times out?
- How are environment variables handled when they're missing or invalid?
- What happens when rollback procedures themselves fail?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST parse YAML files defining operations with steps, environments, and variables
- **FR-002**: System MUST support automatic step execution (running shell commands, API calls)
- **FR-003**: System MUST support manual steps with instructions and confirmation prompts
- **FR-004**: System MUST substitute environment-specific variables in commands and instructions
- **FR-005**: System MUST generate operation documentation in table format comparing environments
- **FR-006**: System MUST support approval gates that block execution until authorized
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide rollback capabilities for each operation step
- **FR-008**: System MUST log all executed commands and their results immutably
- **FR-009**: System MUST support GitHub Actions integration for CI/CD operations
- **FR-010**: System MUST validate YAML operation definitions before execution
- **FR-011**: Users MUST be able to execute operations in different environments using same definition
- **FR-012**: Users MUST be able to view operation status and progress in real-time
- **FR-013**: System MUST prevent execution of production operations without preprod validation [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: how is preprod validation verified?]
- **FR-014**: System MUST authenticate users before allowing operation execution [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: authentication method not specified]
- **FR-015**: System MUST integrate with Confluence for documentation publishing [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific API requirements and authentication]
- **FR-016**: System MUST execute preflight checklists before operation steps to validate prerequisites
- **FR-017**: System MUST support reusable operation modules that can be imported and referenced
- **FR-018**: System MUST resolve module dependencies and variable inheritance automatically
- **FR-019**: System MUST validate preflight checklist items and block execution if any fail
- **FR-020**: Users MUST be able to define custom preflight checks for their operations

### Key Entities
- **Operation**: Represents a complete procedure with name, environments, variables, and ordered steps
- **Step**: Individual action within operation, either automatic (command) or manual (instruction) with optional rollback
- **Environment**: Target deployment context (preprod, production) with specific variable values  
- **Approval Gate**: Checkpoint requiring authorization before proceeding to next step
- **Execution Log**: Immutable record of all commands executed, results, and timestamps
- **Operation Manual**: Generated documentation showing environment comparison and execution details
- **Preflight Checklist**: Set of validation checks that must pass before operation execution begins
- **Operation Module**: Reusable component containing steps, variables, and checklists that can be imported
- **Module Registry**: Collection of available operation modules for sharing and reuse
